                                <p>To be brief, you may start your app with an easy step: put your app ideas on paper
                                    and be as specific as possible. Tools like Balsamiq, Moqups, Justinmind, Proto.io,
                                    and UXpin (most have a free trial), are a great way to create the preliminary

                                    create a new successful app, IT companies like MLSDev can design a mobile app and

                                <p>You would certainly agree that WhatsApp, Instagram, and gaming apps like Angry Birds
                                    and Candy Crash are successful examples. Even though they have each had a different
                                    success story, all of them have something in common. Each of these had a unique app
                                    concept reflected in useful functionality. This core functionality allowed the app
                                    to change user behavior and fall into their daily routine. </p>

                                </p>
                                <p>There are two ingredients for making a successful app. Any startup starts with a
                                    great new app idea and offers an alternative solution for a particular situation.
                                    Secondly, the project must be well-prepared and well-executed. Candy Crush is an
                                    example of a successful game app with a simple but outstanding stone-matching
                                    principle. Today, the app is one of the most downloaded and used applications. </p>
                                <p>In the beginning, all good ideas are mostly unconditional and require some risks.
                                    Thus, if you believe your gut with regard to an app concept, there is a particular
                                    route to undertake. Be prepared- lots of work is required to determine your app’s
                                    success. As a reward, you can secure yourself and receive ROI (return on
                                    investment).</p>

                                    You may think that you have a good app idea, but there are dozens of apps launched
                                    daily. The number of apps appearing in the app stores grows annually. There are over
                                    3 million apps in Google Play and 2 million in the Apple App Store. Other app
                                    marketplaces like Windows Store, Amazon Appstore, and BlackBerry World represent
                                    around 1.3 billion applications globally</p>

                                <p>It is possible to market an app in a small niche for a certain group of people and
                                    their specific needs (ex. cater attorneys of a particular court) or go broad
                                    (application for pregnant women). A micro niche won't have lots of traffic, but will
                                    have higher conversions. In the second case, an app can provide a larger pool of
                                    potential customers and more fierce competition. </p>
                                <p>In any direction, uncovering people’s pain points ensures real value and can make an
                                    app successful. These users are easily attracted and converted into loyal
                                    customers.<br>
                                    The key is to be open, listen, and ask people. Study already existing products, and
                                    surf online resources and social media for the information. Note that to ensure an
                                    application’s success, it is important to define what inspires or irritates your
                                    target audience. </p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>Study forums and questions being asked. One of the more well-known forums is
                                        Quora. Usually, questions are based on some specific problems; why are they not
                                        being fixed. </li>
                                    <li>Search for trends with <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US"
                                            target="_blank">Google</a>. For example, the comparison of <a
                                            href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=iPhone%206,iphone%20X,iphone%207,iphone%208"

                                    <li>Gain some insight with the help of Google Keyword Planner. You can find out what
                                        people are searching for and the volume of such searches per topic. Further
                                        specific keywords can be used for App Store Optimization.</li>
                                    <li>Attend tech startups, meetups, and hackathons. This can help you understand what
                                        kind of ideas are currently interesting to the crowd. Additionally, search
                                        Meetup.com for local events.</li>
                                    <li>Take some time to observe the world around you. What are the issues people
                                        encounter daily that are inefficient? As an example, there is an urgent
                                        necessity to help restaurants reduce their food waste.</li>
                                    <li>Conduct polls &amp; questionnaires among potential app users. Receive feedback
                                        from your friends about what exactly is valuable for an app to do.</li>
                                    <li>Ask potential users on social networks and their groups. Search in: Reddit
                                        Startup, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. </li>
                                    <li>Speak to business owners about their current, and potential future, pain
                                        points.<br></li>
                                    <li>Check vendors and organization that provide startup funding, like Y Combinator.

                                            is a list</a> of the most well-known Seed Accelerators. </li>
                                    <li>Check all the top apps and top app categories of your interest. You can check
                                        what solutions these apps provide for their users and compare with your idea.

                                    <li>Check CrunchBase for successful mobile apps succeeding in the seed funding
                                        rounds. </li>
                                    <li>A tool like AppTweak can help you understand whether some competitive apps are
                                        in the top charts for downloads. This means they have solid and valid app ideas
                                        being ranked at the top. </li>
                                </ol>

                                </p>
                                <p>A final recommendation - since the US app market is very hard to approach, consider a
                                    less competitive market to launch an app. The volume of installs required to get
                                    into the Top 25 in the USA is around 30 times higher than in Mexico. Thus, Latin
                                    America and Asia are good alternatives, and CPI (click per install) is cheaper there
                                    as well. </p>

                                            Naming an app can be tricky. Yet, it is important to be catchy and
                                            recognizable. As well, it should be SEO friendly. Consider keywords and

                                            Conduct keyword research before the app launch. You will then be able to
                                            quickly proceed with optimized listings and pages. These keywords should be

                                    Building a successful app is like building a unique house; enough time should be
                                    spent on its architectural plan. <br>
                                    Attention to detail always pays off. </p>

                                    It is important to understand what you want to accomplish with this app business.
                                    Make these goals as specific as possible. The SMART goal-setting principle can be
                                    helpful to ensure that goals are realistic and time-bound. As a reference, nail down

                                <p>Another important element prior to app development is the content. Imagine what

                                    the onboarding process and welcome message to engage them successfully. Try to
                                    design and write this app content in advance. </p>

                                    execution of the product being fault-tolerant. You need to understand how
                                    technologies can make an app better with regard to performance and collect the
                                    expertise to build a successful application. At the same time it is important to

                                    or both iOS/Android), or hybrid. </p>

                                <p><strong>3. Resources &amp; Costs</strong><br>
                                    Logically, you need to understand the budget required for successful app
                                    development. The budget required to make the project successful depends on many
                                    factors: development contractor, complexity &amp; number of features, etc. This can
                                    be compared with the cost of a car or a house. The cone of uncertainty states that
                                    the project cost and timeline in the very beginning are hard to define. No two
                                    projects have the same requirements, people involved, business context,
                                    technologies, and constraints. </p>

                                <p>It is critical to select a capable development team. You may consider these options:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>local developers </li>
                                    <li>project outsourcing model (for example, to Ukraine)</li>
                                    <li>freelance or partner platforms like UpWork or Freelancer.com</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Local US developers cost far more than offshore employees or an employing freelance
                                    platform. Good applications developed by large software companies are rather costly
                                    - around $500k-$1m. Whereas, smaller US agencies can cost somewhere between
                                    $150k-$450k. Other even smaller app development shops price their service around
                                    $50k to $100k.</p>
                                <p>Is close proximity to a development team important to you, or is cost-efficiency your
                                    preference? In the latter case, our team recommends that you try the benefits of
                                    outsourcing mobile app development. This is the best fit for both quality and
                                    monetary resources. On average, the development costs for MVP start at $30k - $50k.
                                </p>
                                <p>The timeline of app development is influenced by the same factors: number features,
                                    app requirements, technical approach, and priorities. In general, the process varies
                                    from 3 to 5 months. Of course, the first app version can be built faster for beta
                                    testing. If the project is more sophisticated, 5 months or more may be required.

                                <p><strong>4. Marketing &amp; Rewards Evaluation</strong><br>
                                    The initial purpose of any business is to earn money. In a successful app business,
                                    these rewards are obvious; it is either a percentage of traffic turned into sales or
                                    reduced operational costs in dollars per transaction. However, please note that
                                    profit occurs later on in the process, whereas costs occur at one single point. A
                                    budget should include the money required to implement an app marketing plan plus the
                                    product development. </p>
                                <p>It is worth mentioning that it is important to understand how the defined
                                    functionality and chosen monetization model resonate with potential users. There are
                                    different ways to monetize your application successfully for future product versions
                                    and your app developer should advise you on the best model:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>free apps </li>

                                            Dropbox</em></li>
                                    <li>paid apps ( with in-app purchases or subscription model, employing virtual
                                        inside currency or goods), <em>e.g Pokemon Go with PokeCoins, AngryBirds</em>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>apps paid per download </li>
                                    <li>cross-selling of apps (e-commerce transactions), <em>e.g Evernote with sales via

                                    documentation, design, and coding. Everything should not only correspond with
                                    guidelines and unique operational system aspects, but also provide value with each
                                    detail.</p>

                                <p>UX/UI design is another significant element that makes for a good app. Here are the
                                    top tips on how to design a mobile app successfully: </p>
                                <p><strong>1. Follow the design guidelines</strong><br>
                                    It is impossible to omit this part.<a href="https://developer.android.com/design/"
                                        target="_blank"> Android</a> and <a
                                        href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/"
                                        target="_blank">iOS</a> systems have their own design guidelines for a good app
                                    that should be followed in order to be accepted in their stores. As well, each
                                    platform has its own unique features in terms of user navigation and experience.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>2. Responsive design, as an alternative</strong><br>
                                    Given the high expenses at the very start, it is possible to lower costs with the
                                    help of responsive design. This allows for the creation of a design that corresponds
                                    to all operating systems. The code can then render differently on laptops, tablets,
                                    and smartphones. Responsive design is an efficient way to optimize the user
                                    experience across all these platforms. </p>
                                <p><strong>3. Polished design</strong><br>
                                    This may differentiate your product from competitive ones. Details really matter.
                                    The inclusion of some tasteful graphics, animations, interactions, and sound effects
                                    can change the picture dramatically. Take web and mobile app design trends into
                                    consideration. As an example, the Candy Crush Saga - every time a user proceeds to
                                    the next level, the game has unique sounds to match the theme. </p>
                                <p><strong>4. Logical and simple design elements</strong><br>
                                    The KISS (keep it simple stupid) principle is a great one to apply. However, each
                                    element should add value and have a specific role. Based on the idea for the mobile
                                    app and budget constraints, the design can consist of different elements that you
                                    may choose from: low fidelity UX, high fidelity UX, UI mockups, illustration and
                                    animations, and what best corresponds with product goals. Check this info here: How

                                <p>The 2-tap rule tests how easy is it to work with an app. Does it take 2 taps to do
                                    what you want with the app? The 5-point rule counts a point for each different font,
                                    color, and size of an element on a page/screen. If the number of elements is more
                                    than 5, you need to redesign it. The 98% rule states that every product should be
                                    designed in a way that can be used 98% of the time. </p>
                                <p><strong>6. Branding is also important</strong><br>
                                    A great logo will make your app stand out and be memorable. The principles of
                                    effective logo creation, like the delivered message, composition, color combination,
                                    and adaptability can help you with this task.</p>

                                <p>Once your designs are complete, the development stage comes into force. The following
                                    are app development tips for building high-performing and stable product:</p>
                                <p><strong>1. Focus on the app’s core functionality</strong><br>
                                    Based on research and a defined strategy, the app should focus on a specific
                                    problem, and include a specific core functionality that solves it. Moreover,
                                    according to a bit of Standish Group research, only 20% of app’s functions are used
                                    often. Therefore, all the development efforts should be allocated toward these
                                    features, especially in the first product version. </p>
                                <p><strong>2. Simple intuitive registration</strong><br>
                                    Today users can be quite impatient. The simpler the registration process is, the
                                    better. For example, you may offer registration with the help of a social network,
                                    which usually takes only 2 taps. </p>
                                <p><strong>3. Ensure that even your MVP is secure</strong><br>
                                    Security is of high importance, especially given a recent Facebook scandal and
                                    resulting GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Keeping user information safe
                                    and encrypted is the best way to develop an app. As well, make sure that the system
                                    uses secure HTTPS protocols. </p>
                                <p><strong>4. Offer relevant notifications and define tags</strong><br>
                                    This part heavily interacts with content app strategy, per the case defined prior.
                                    Over 70% of users are looking for a personalized experience with the brands with
                                    which they interact. Thus, it is vital to collect profile data from user history in
                                    order to deliver useful content. The tagging structure can help you to notify your
                                    users with useful information.</p>

                                <p>Sending these pre-planned automated messages can result in better user engagement.
                                    Targeting the right user with the right information, at the right time, and with the
                                    proper message means you care for them. This can lead to higher user retention and
                                    ongoing success of the app.</p>
                                <p><strong>5. Build communication channels with the app users</strong><br>
                                    Research indicates that only 42% of users will respond to notifications. Hence,
                                    there is a necessity to build different communication channels with users. Some
                                    solutions are in-app messaging and an in-app message center. Ideally, the app should
                                    include both from the beginning. A message center is an inbox within the app that
                                    allows for engagement with users. Similarly, an in-app messaging allows users to
                                    send messages to others who are active in the app.</p>
                                <p><strong>6. Develop for both iOS and Android</strong><br>
                                    How do you develop an app natively or using cross-functional solution? First, take
                                    your budget into account - but in order for the app to become successful, it is
                                    vital to cover both the iOS and Android platforms. The third approach would be to
                                    cover the web, iOS, and Android by building the responsive web application and
                                    making it adaptive to mobile screens. With this approach, you do not have to build
                                    separate apps for different operating systems.</p>
                                <p><strong>7. Provide offline functionality</strong><br>
                                    The majority of apps offer functionality via an Internet connection. On the other
                                    hand, users do not always to have access to the internet. Thus, equipping your
                                    application with an offline feature is a great advantage.</p>
                                <p><strong>8. Sustain high performance</strong><br>
                                    An apps performance is a key factor in defining whether or not it is good.
                                    Dimensional Research indicates that users will attempt to use an app a maximum of
                                    three times if they are experiencing any issues. It is critical to eliminate all
                                    possible bugs and provide efficient speed when it is time to launch the app.
                                    Successful apps respond quickly and do not crash.</p>
                                <p><strong>9. Offer it for free</strong><br>
                                    10. There is a huge difference between $0.00 and $0.99 for a user. Thus, offering
                                    the possibility to test the application could bring success. Once users like the app
                                    and it becomes something of value to them, they become more willing to pay. Further
                                    monetization depends on your strategy and product type. </p>
                                <p><strong>10. Integrate social share within an app</strong><br>
                                    This last app development tip can assist you with a further app promotion. Once they
                                    have discovered the application, users can share their in-app content, screens, etc,
                                    with others. This results in increased app visibility and a community to make your
                                    app successful.</p>

                                    requires a meticulous plan, schedule, and control. The main objective is to
                                    integrate all the processes on a production level and conduct proper app testing
                                    before the release. Some preliminary work is required: </p>

                                    <li>
                                        <p><strong>Integrate analytics tools</strong><br>
                                            Ideally, there is a need to connect corresponding analytical services. This
                                            gives an in-depth picture of target users. These are: Google Analytics,
                                            Flurry, Localytics, Mixpanel, Fabric, Appsee, etc. </p>

                                            This also ideal in order to complete your MVP and determine your app’s
                                            success. Conducting beta testing is the first opportunity to receive real
                                            feedback and consists of 3 essential elements: </p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Defining the target users. Identification of the right target testers can help
                                        eliminate risks and improve app performance. As well, with the Android app, it
                                        is possible to test different features before the launch. </li>
                                    <li>Elimination of as many bugs as possible. For the beta-testing, you need to test
                                        all the functionalities on all product platforms. </li>
                                    <li>Analysis of the strategy and initial goals. Beta-testing can help to redefine
                                        your initial strategy and allow you to make a pivot in the product development.

                                <p>As it has been mentioned, app stores are known as the main app distribution channel.
                                    Therefore, let's discover Google play and the App Store to better understand how to
                                    market applications. </p>
                                <p>John Dinsmore, a mobile app market researcher, explains that many developers believe
                                    only in app quality. This means that if the app brings value and works well, it will
                                    naturally attain healthy growth and move to the top. </p>
                                <p>However, just 10% of the most successful applications are installed by the vast
                                    majority of users. Does this mean that the other 90% are that bad? Not really. The
                                    chances are that only a few people have discovered and installed them. There are
                                    three primary ways to reveal an app: </p>
                                <p>1) Top charts. These are dominated by the most successful apps with the largest paid
                                    media campaigns<br><br>
                                    2) 2) Selected (curated) content <em>(e.g. what is within the current
                                        trends)</em><br>
                                    3) Search within the app store by category, keywords</p>
                                <p><em>Note: check out how current apps are revealed in the refreshed App Store.</em>
                                </p>

                                <p>I suppose this should give you a clue - at most, 2 apps can be viewed at the top of
                                    the screen. The point being, whatever great idea you might have, without a proper
                                    app marketing plan, your chances of making a successful app account to zero. </p>
                                <h4>App Store Optimization</h4>
                                <p>ASO is a general way to ensure your app is discovered by target users. This is a
                                    diligent task with keywords, descriptions, and titles to overtake your competitors.
                                    It could take years of continuous optimization, including regular app updates to get
                                    to the top 10 in your category. As an example, it took considerable effort and time
                                    for the iBirth App to become the top spot for Pregnancy &amp; Nutrition category.
                                </p>
                                <p>It is worth mentioning that app ranking is based on install velocity in the App
                                    Store; meaning the more installs are made in a short amount of time, the higher the
                                    app is placed. This indication is hard to achieve without the help of PR or
                                    Advertising agencies, but it is still possible. On the other hand, being in the top
                                    does not always guarantee real success. </p>

                                <p>Real app success can be evaluated by the efforts made and whether or not mobile app
                                    campaigns are successful. It is necessary to define how to market an app before
                                    launch and what channels to use for successful app delivery to the target user. </p>
                                <p><strong>1. Social media promotion (e.g. Camera+)</strong><br>
                                    One of the easiest things to do in the pre-launch period is to utilize all social
                                    channels like: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Make use of those social
                                    networks that are potentially used by your prospective users. From another
                                    perspective, join groups in LinkedIn and FB to spread the word about the app. These
                                    posts should be regular and should encourage people to download the app once ready.
                                    As well, you can start blogging or creating podcasts related to the product.</p>
                                <p>The founders of Camera+ chose to build up some buzz on most social networks. They
                                    positioned the app to have a sharing feature considered the best among all similar
                                    apps. As well, they included a contest with a prize - a camera worth $10k. This
                                    resulted in a mailing list of 70,000 subscribers. </p>
                                <p><strong>2. Get press attention (e.g. Evernote)</strong><br>
                                    Getting press attention also results in the word being spread around. For instance,
                                    when TechCrunch wrote about Evernote, it resulted in a couple of thousand sign-ups
                                    for its beta-product. Therefore, reaching out to different news portals can be a
                                    great means support in promoting an app. As a piece of advice, you should prepare
                                    your PR kit to consist of at least some of the following: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>app summary guide</li>
                                    <li>app screenshots </li>
                                    <li>design materials (icons, logo, banners)</li>
                                    <li>video (walkthroughs, intro video) </li>
                                    <li>founder(s) biography &amp; picture</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Another possibility is to be featured on successful mobile app review sites.
                                    Beforehand, you need to send out a pitch to convince a platform to place your great
                                    app idea on the website. You may try out this <a
                                        href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OkyL-r6XQz0QIat_nVJtVF3pWQGsVOdGcesbBBFrTs0/edit#gid=0"
                                        rel="nofollow" target="_blank">100+list of such websites</a>. </p>
                                <p><strong>3. Reach out to influencers (e.g. Instagram)</strong><br>
                                    Addressing top bloggers and online personas would be a great way to generate
                                    interest among potential users. Instagram’s founder Kevin Systrom, let influential
                                    blogger on Twitter try the beta-product before the official Instagram release. This
                                    resulted in 24,000 users within 24 hours, and as many as 300,000 by the third week.
                                    Thus, developing authentic and mutually beneficial relationships with influencers
                                    will go a long way toward promoting your app successfully. You may also try
                                    Crunchbase, BuzzSumo, and LinkedIn to find these influencers. </p>
                                <p><strong>4. Develop a landing page</strong><br>
                                    The sooner you start building a mailing list of interested app users, the better.
                                    Therefore, the landing page can be of great use either on a website (if you have
                                    one) or with the help of some ready-made solutions (Leadpages, LaunchRock). This
                                    page should be promoted via Google advertisements, social media, or shares by
                                    influencers. The message needs to offer information regarding the key benefits of
                                    the app, including features, sample screens, demo video, etc. This preview section
                                    should be followed by a simple news sign-up form. Once the app is released, include
                                    the app download links.</p>
                                <p><strong>5. Post on PreApps</strong><br>
                                    PreApps is another type of site used to generate interest for the app in its early

                                <p>In order to make an app successful in a short period of time, it is vital to measure,
                                    learn, and react in a rapidly changing environment. For this purpose, you need to
                                    understand your app’s value and performance aligned with knowing app KPIs (key
                                    performance indicators). First, it is necessary to define the KPIs that matter most
                                    and directly relate to the marketing plan. Then, based on these collected metrics,
                                    successful app adjustments can be made. </p>
