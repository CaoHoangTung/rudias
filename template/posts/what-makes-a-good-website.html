                                    <p>Before I start spatting off lessons, I want to ensure you can take something away
                                        and implement it&nbsp;<em>today</em>.</p>
                                    <p>So, here are the four basic principles of what makes a good website to keep in
                                        mind before your redesign/launch:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Purpose.&nbsp;</strong>Great design starts with a&nbsp;purpose in
                                            mind. Ask yourself, “What do I want to accomplish with this page?” If a page
                                            doesn’t have a clear purpose, consider getting rid of it.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Aesthetically pleasing.&nbsp;</strong>I’ll dig more into this in
                                            section one on visual design, but your site needs to look good. If your site
                                            looks like it was built in the 90’s, it’s time for an update.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Relevant and original content.&nbsp;</strong>Your site should show
                                            content that’s relevant to your target market and original. Plagiarism is
                                            illegal and penalized by Google. Besides, it’s better to be a first-rate
                                            version of yourself than a second-rate version of someone else.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Clear site navigation.&nbsp;</strong>I’ll discuss this further in
                                            section two on technical aspects, but know that navigation matters. Any page
                                            on your site should be within three clicks of any other page on your site.
                                            Your navigation should be intuitive and simple. This helps both Google for
                                            SEO and your visitors for navigation.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p>Now that you have the major principles in mind, let’s dive a little deeper.</p>
                                    <h3 id="visual"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Visual Website Design (AKA
                                            “Prettiness”)</span></h3>
                                    <p>Imagine a scenario for a moment.</p>
                                    <p>You’re looking for a gift for your sister’s birthday. You notice a tweet by
                                        someone you follow sharing their friend’s new clothing shop. You click.</p>
                                    <p>Then you see this.</p>
                                    <p><img class="alignnone wp-image-976 size-large"
                                            src="https://www.formilla.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ugly-website-design-1024x533.png"

                                    <p>Haha, nope. You’re gone.</p>
                                    <p>Is this an extreme example? Yes.</p>
                                    <p>Does website design still matter a whole heck of a lot? Yup.</p>
                                    <p>Am I going to tell you what you should do to make your site look great? You
                                        betcha.</p>
                                    <p>You see, visuals affect everything from conversion rate to time on page,
                                        trustworthiness, and organic backlinks (which help you rank your site on
                                        Google.)</p>
                                    <p>So the equation looks like this:</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Great site design = More trust = Better
                                            conversions</strong></p>

                                    <p style="text-align: left;">How do you make your site look great? Start with your
                                        brand.</p>
                                    <h4 style="text-align: left;">Branding Through Site Design</h4>
                                    <p>Your brand is your image. Everything from the colors you use to the fonts you
                                        choose affects people’s perception of who you are.</p>
                                    <p>In her <a href="http://freshsparks.com/successful-brand-building-process/"
                                            target="_blank">guide to branding</a>, Sonia Gregory says that “as a small
                                        business, you may be competing against big brands with devoted customers. That’s
                                        why you have to find ways to differentiate–with a solid brand building process
                                        of your own.”</p>
                                    <p>What do you want people to think when they see your site?</p>
                                    <p>Edgy, modern, satirical, professional, something else?</p>
                                    <p>You can convey those things through your design. Just take a look at the <a
                                            href="https://www.quicksprout.com/the-complete-guide-to-understand-customer-psychology-chapter-4/"
                                            target="_blank">psychology of color</a> – different colors convey different
                                        emotions.</p>
                                    <p>In fact, a study titled “<a
                                            href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/00251740610673332"

                                        <strong>90% of snap judgments made about products can be based on color
                                            alone</strong>, depending on the product.</p>
                                    <p>Beyond color, you also have font choice.&nbsp;And yes, there is a <a

                                            target="_blank">psychology behind font choice</a> as well. Ted Hunt from
                                        Crazy Egg made this cool infographic about it:</p>
                                    <p><img class="alignnone wp-image-977 size-large"
                                            src="https://www.formilla.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Psychology_Behind_Type-711x1024.jpg"

                                    <p>Regardless of the font you choose for your logo and branding efforts, you should
                                        always <strong>choose readability over emotional feel for your main body
                                            font</strong>. Typically that means sans serif fonts, as they read the best
                                        on the web.</p>
                                    <p>One last tip on font choice: Don’t use more than two fonts in your design. <a

                                            target="_blank">Pick two that compliment each other</a>&nbsp;and stick with
                                        those for your entire brand.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Key Takeaway:&nbsp;</strong>Choose no more than three colors and two
                                        fonts to represent your brand. Write down the fonts and color codes and use them
                                        consistently across your entire site and marketing efforts.</p>
                                    <h4>Finding, Designing, and Using Images</h4>
                                    <p>Imagery is a major part of website design. And yet so many people do it wrong.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Great images add value to the visitor. They help explain a key point and give the
                                        eyes a break. They even help sell your products and services.</p>
                                    <p>For example, if you’re an eCommerce site, you want your product photos to be
                                        high-quality and show tons of different angles.</p>
                                    <p>Which of these flowers would you rather buy?</p>

                                    <p>Remember design principle #1: Great design has a purpose in mind.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Any image that doesn’t have a purpose is a bad image. Period.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>If you needed more incentive, page load speed (which I discuss in section two),
                                        is extremely important to SEO and usability. Having too many big images slows
                                        your site down.</p>
                                    <p>So, how do you find, design, and use images on your website?</p>

                                        <li>Charts and graphs of data points</li>
                                        <li>Screenshots</li>
                                        <li>High-quality stock photography (choose wisely)</li>
                                        <li>Custom designs and vector graphics</li>

                                    <h4>Responsive Design and Mobile-Friendliness</h4>
                                    <p>According to Smashing Magazine’s post&nbsp;<a
                                            href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/"
                                            target="_blank"><em>Responsive Web Design: What It Is And How To Use
                                                It</em></a>:</p>
                                    <p>“Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development
                                        should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size,
                                        platform and orientation.”</p>
                                    <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-983 size-full"
                                            src="https://www.formilla.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Responsive-Web-Design-e1492574790298.png"

                                    <p>In other words, a responsive site is one that plays well on all screens and
                                        devices. It’s mobile-friendly and caters to the device you’re viewing it on.</p>
                                    <p>If you think that sounds complicated… it is.</p>
                                    <p>But it’s important.&nbsp;In fact, smartphones now account for <a
                                            href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/"
                                            target="_blank">over 51%</a> of all online traffic, and tablets came in at
                                        just over 12%. And that number is growing.</p>
                                    <p>Also, Google cares a lot about mobile-friendliness. In fact, they now place a
                                        priority on ranking mobile-friendly sites (an update called “<a
                                            href="http://searchengineland.com/mobilegeddon-beginning-not-ending-220512"
                                            target="_blank">Mobilegeddon</a>“).</p>
                                    <p>Finally, mobile-friendly makes for a better user experience. And ultimately, it’s
                                        all about the user. They’re the ones opening their wallets to keep your business
                                        afloat.</p>
                                    <p><strong>So what’s a non-designer to do?</strong></p>
                                    <p>First, see if your site is considered mobile-friendly by Google with their <a
                                            href="https://search.google.com/search-console/mobile-friendly"
                                            target="_blank">mobile-friendly test</a>. It’s also a good idea to check it
                                        yourself by going to your site on your phone. If it doesn’t score well or look
                                        good, you have some work to do.</p>

                                    <p>Besides hiring a designer, your best bet is to change your site’s template. This
                                        is the easiest and most affordable way to make your site mobile-friendly and

                                    <h4>Fast Website Load Speed</h4>
                                    <p>According to <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/"
                                            target="_blank">surveys done by Akamai and Gomez.com</a>, nearly
                                        <em>half</em> of web users expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less, and they
                                        tend to abandon a site that isn’t loaded in 3 seconds!</p>
                                    <p>That doesn’t give you much wiggle room. But if you’re still not convinced, get
                                        this:</p>
                                    <p>Roughly 79% of online shoppers who have trouble with website performance say they
                                        won’t return to the site to buy again, and around 44% of them would tell a
                                        friend if they had a poor experience shopping online.</p>
                                    <p>In other words, if your site speed sucks, you lose. Big Time.</p>
                                    <p>So how do you ensure a fast load speed? Try this:</p>
                                    <p>Like the mobile-friendly test, Google also has a <a
                                            href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/"
                                            target="_blank">page speed test</a>. However, some believe it’s not very
                                        accurate, so it can’t hurt to also try <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/"
                                            target="_blank">Pingdom</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/"
                                            target="_blank">GT Metrix</a>.</p>
                                    <p>All three will give you an idea of what’s hurting your load speeds, with
                                        suggestions to improve.</p>

                                    <p>As you can see, there are a lot of <a

                                            target="_blank">ways to improve your site load speed</a>,&nbsp;like browser
                                        caching and making above-the-fold content load first (the content you see
                                        without scrolling down the page).</p>
                                    <p>However, one of the easiest ways is <strong>optimizing and compressing your
                                            images</strong>. As I said in the visual section, images take up a lot of
                                        bandwidth. Which is why it’s important to only use images that are highly
                                        valuable.</p>
                                    <p>You can use a tool like <a href="https://www.gimp.org/"

                                    <p>SEO means optimizing your site to show up in search engines like Google. It’s the
                                        bread and butter of what makes a good website.</p>
                                    <p>Done right, it can drive thousands in traffic to your site every month without
                                        any extra effort.</p>
                                    <p>Done poorly, not a soul will find you on Google.</p>

                                    <h4>Securing Your Site with SSL Encryption</h4>
                                    <p>You’ve probably seen the little green lock in your address bar next to a website.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>This is called SSL encryption.</p>

                                            target="_blank">small SEO boost</a>. But perhaps more important than that is
                                        the trust factor it gives your visitors.</p>
                                    <p>This is especially true if you sell anything on your website. People want to know
                                        their information is safe before they open their wallet.</p>

                                    <h4>Site Architecture &amp; Navigation</h4>
                                    <p>Remember design principle #4: Have a clear&nbsp;site navigation.</p>
                                    <p>Navigation is important for two main reasons:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Better SEO (because it makes it easier for Google to index your site).</li>
                                        <li>Better usability (because it’s easier for visitors to find their way
                                            around).</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Remember to use the <strong>“three click rule”</strong>: Every page on your site
                                        should be within three clicks of any other page on your site.</p>
                                    <p>To help you with this, consider mapping out your website. You can do it with a
                                        tool like <a href="https://slickplan.com/" target="_blank">Slickplan</a>&nbsp;or
                                        just use pen and paper. They look like this:</p>

                                    <p>Creating a physical map helps you see where you’re missing out on linking pages
                                        together, and keeps things organized.</p>
                                    <p>You should also&nbsp;<strong>keep your most important calls-to-action at the top
                                            of the page.</strong> This is where the most people see, so it’s a great
                                        place for a “shop now” button, a “contact us” tab, or a “learn more” button.</p>

                                    <p>We’ve come to the end of our journey. Give yourself a pat on the back.</p>
                                    <p>So what did we learn?</p>
                                    <p>Basically, your website is your business card. It’s the thing everyone – your
                                        customers, shareholders, friends, family, and cat – sees when they think of
                                        doing business with you.</p>
                                    <p>By keeping your website looking sharp, you ensure everyone who visits it views
                                        you as trustworthy, professional, and worthy of doing business with.</p>
                                    <p>Plus, a strong website pulls in traffic through Google, gets links from
                                        authoritative sites, and is shared more often.</p>
                                    <p>We’re in 2017. A great website is no longer a “nice to have”. It’s an absolute
                                        must.</p>
