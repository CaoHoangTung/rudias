                                    at Capital IQ, almost 10 years ago. I didn’t even apply for the job. A friend told
                                    me they were hiring, and I asked if there were any roles for people like me —
                                    engineers who liked Photoshop. After talking to a few people, I was told I’d make a
                                    good Business Analyst (their term for Product Manager, I’d later learn). The
                                    combination of business and analysis sounded intriguing, so I jumped on the offer.
                                </p>

                                    data-selectable-paragraph="">My responsibilities were gathering business
                                    requirements, specifying features, passing the specs off to engineers, mocking up
                                    the interfaces in Photoshop, user acceptance testing, gathering feedback from
                                    customers, user research, and managing the scope. The company was far from Agile or
                                    Lean at the time, but I didn’t know any better. I loved it. Solving problems and
                                    watching them come to life was way better than my other options — supply chain
                                    management or coding.</p>

                                    data-selectable-paragraph="">Four years later at OpenSky, I heard the term “User
                                    Experience Designer” for the first time. My boss announced we were hiring a Director
                                    of UX. Apparently my role as a Product Manager was not the same as a UX Designer.
                                    What?! I was blindsided. The UX Director was now in charge of all the interface
                                    designs and mockups. He made it sound like a good thing. “Congrats! You don’t have
                                    to do any more wireframes.”</p>

                                    data-selectable-paragraph="">But I loved designing. I loved creating flows that
                                    solved problems.</p>
                                <p id="9ac5" class="hh hi ar bj hk b hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv eb"
                                    data-selectable-paragraph="">The developers were finally participating in the
                                    process too. We were sketching together, incorporating each other’s ideas, and
                                    pairing on iterations. When the new Director of UX started, most of that went away.
                                    Now there were hand offs. I was still testing product ideas, but I didn’t get to
                                    participate in what that looked like for the user.</p>
                                <p id="4db5" class="hh hi ar bj hk b hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv eb"
                                    data-selectable-paragraph="">Quickly I realized this was not the role I wanted. I
                                    left to become the Lead UX Designer at another company. Now I had the opposite
                                    problem. I wasn’t allowed to participate in feature decisions. Those were made by
                                    the Product Managers. I was just the person who designed them. I felt like Lucy and
                                    Ethel in the chocolate factory, trying to wrap up all these features in pretty
                                    designs. The conveyor belt never stopped.</p>

                                    for General Assembly, we had trouble here as well. There were weeks dedicated to
                                    topics some saw purely as UX — personas, research, wireframes, etc. But these are
                                    all necessary for Product Management too.</p>

                                    data-selectable-paragraph="">I’ve found the definition of roles matters less than
                                    how a company operates. Highly collaborative teams have Product Managers and UX
                                    Designers who assign each other tasks based on what they need for the project.
                                    Whoever is best suited in that moment to do it, does it. They agree on this.
                                    Sometimes the UX Designer might be doing research, other times the PM, and
                                    hopefully, more often than not, they’ll both work on it together. Everyone can move
                                    forward without feeling territorial.</p>

                                    and UX Designers are important, but what’s more important is that these two people
                                    can make decisions together. <mark class="os ot kj"><strong class="hk jg">Product

                                    If these two roles are not sharing responsibilities, then you will have a disconnect
                                    in both your team and product.</p>

                                    of role definition, it becomes clearer. Do we have all the skills we need on this
                                    team to validate and execute a product idea? If we have a Product Manager who cannot
                                    wireframe, let’s hire a UX Designer. If we have a Product Manager who does UX
                                    Design, let’s hire a Visual Designer. If we truly want to iterate and get to market
                                    faster, we need to focus on limiting our team size. Having too many moving pieces
                                    only slows us down. Limit the scope of the work and make more teams rather than
                                    adding on roles or people to one.</p>
